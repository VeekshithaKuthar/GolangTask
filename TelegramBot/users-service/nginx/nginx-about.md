## nginx podman runnign

```bash
podman run -d --name nginx --network demo-network -p 9090:80 -v ${PWD}\nginx\nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro nginx
```


Great—let’s walk through your config block-by-block and explain what each piece does, what scope it lives in, and a few gotchas/improvements.

---

# Top level

```nginx
worker_processes auto;
events { worker_connections 1024; }
```

* **worker\_processes auto;**
  Lets NGINX spawn one worker per CPU core (good default for most servers).

* **events { worker\_connections 1024; }**
  Per-worker concurrent connections cap. Effective theoretical max ≈ `workers × 1024`. (Each proxied client usually costs two connections—client↔NGINX and NGINX↔upstream.)

---

# http block (applies to all servers)

```nginx
http {
  sendfile on;
  tcp_nopush on;
  tcp_nodelay on;
  keepalive_timeout 65;
  types_hash_max_size 4096;
  include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
  default_type  application/octet-stream;
```

* **sendfile on;** Serve files via kernel zero-copy—fewer context switches.
* **tcp\_nopush / tcp\_nodelay;** Tuning for packet coalescing vs. immediate sends (sensible defaults).
* **keepalive\_timeout 65;** Idle keep-alive close time for client ↔ NGINX.
* **types\_hash\_max\_size / include mime.types / default\_type** Control how content types are mapped; `default_type` is a fallback.

---

## Upstream (your app pool)

```nginx
  upstream dbui {
    least_conn;
    server pgui:8080 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s;
    server pgui2:8080 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s;
    # keepalive 64;   # optional
  }
```

* **upstream dbui { … }** A named pool your `proxy_pass` can target.
* **least\_conn;** New requests go to the server with the fewest active connections (better than round-robin for uneven request times).
* **server pgui:8080 / pgui2:8080;** Two identical app containers on the same user-defined network; NGINX resolves these by container DNS name.
* **max\_fails / fail\_timeout;** *Passive* health checks. If a server fails `max_fails` times in `fail_timeout`, NGINX marks it down temporarily.
* **keepalive 64;** (commented) Reuses upstream TCP connections for multiple requests (HTTP/1.1); reduces connect latency.

> Tip: If you scale dynamically and want auto-discovery, plain OSS NGINX won’t watch Docker/Podman; you’d regenerate this list and `nginx -s reload`, or use an orchestrator (Swarm/K8s/Ingress) or a templater (docker-gen, consul-template).

---

## (Commented) Sticky sessions block

```nginx
  # sticky cookie app_sticky ...
```

* This directive **isn’t available in stock OSS NGINX**. It’s an **NGINX Plus** feature (or via a third-party module).
* If you need stickiness on OSS, use `ip_hash;` (crude) or app-level session stores/Redis.

---

# Server block (virtual host)

```nginx
  server {
    listen 80;
    # listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name _;
```

* **listen 80;** HTTP endpoint.
* **server\_name \_;** Catch-all (matches any host).
* **TLS lines commented**—when you add certs, enable `listen 443 ssl http2;` and set `ssl_certificate`/`ssl_certificate_key`.

---

## Health endpoint (NGINX itself)

```nginx
    location = /healthz { return 200 'ok'; add_header Content-Type text/plain; }
```

* Responds quickly from NGINX without touching your app—useful for container/orchestrator probes.

---

## Reverse proxy to the app pool

```nginx
    location / {
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Host              $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

      # WebSocket support
      proxy_set_header Upgrade           $http_upgrade;
    # proxy_set_header Connection        $connection_upgrade;
    #   map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    #     default upgrade;
    #     ''      close;
    #   }

      proxy_read_timeout 75s;
      proxy_send_timeout 75s;

      proxy_pass http://dbui;
    }
```

**What each does:**

* **proxy\_http\_version 1.1;** Needed for keepalive & WebSockets (HTTP/1.1).
* **Host, X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Proto**: Preserve client host/protocol and pass real client IP—critical for app logs, redirects, auth callbacks.
* **WebSockets:**

  * You correctly set `Upgrade: $http_upgrade`.
  * **But `Connection: $connection_upgrade` is commented** and so is the `map`. Without that `map` **at the `http {}` level**, upgrades can fail on some clients/proxies.
  * Fix: define the map in `http {}` and set the header in `location`:

    ```nginx
    # in http {}
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
      default upgrade;
      ''      close;
    }
    # in location /
    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    ```
* **proxy\_read\_timeout / proxy\_send\_timeout:** Allow long-lived responses (WS/long polling/gRPC over h2c proxy, etc.).
* **proxy\_pass [http://dbui](http://dbui);** Sends requests to the upstream pool you defined.

# Common improvements (optional but recommended)

Add any that fit your needs:

```nginx
http {
  # 1) Real client IP when behind another LB/Proxy
  # set_real_ip_from 10.0.0.0/8;   # your LB subnet(s)
  # real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
  # real_ip_recursive on;

  # 2) Larger uploads if your app needs it
  # client_max_body_size 25m;

  # 3) Compression (static/dynamic). Enable carefully to avoid double-compressing already compressed content.
  # gzip on;
  # gzip_types text/plain text/css application/javascript application/json application/xml;
  # gzip_min_length 1024;

  # 4) Hide version
  # server_tokens off;

  # 5) Upstream keepalive for better latency
  # upstream dbui { ... keepalive 64; }

  # 6) Buffers (tune if streaming or very large headers/bodies)
  # proxy_buffering on;     # default on. For live streaming/WebSockets keep as default or turn off per location if needed.
  # proxy_buffers 16 16k;
  # proxy_busy_buffers_size 24k;
}
```

If you plan to enable **HTTPS**:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  server_name _;

  ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/certs/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/privkey.pem;

  # Good starting point; consider a hardened suite
  # ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  # ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
}
```

---

# Quick validation & lifecycle

```bash
# Test syntax (inside the running container)
podman exec -it nginx nginx -t

# Reload without dropping connections
podman exec -it nginx nginx -s reload

# See which config file is loaded
podman exec -it nginx nginx -T | head -n 50
```

## TL;DR key fixes for your file

1. Move the **`map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade { ... }`** into the **`http {}`** block.
2. Un-comment `proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;` in `location /`.
3. (Optional) Add `keepalive 64;` in the upstream for better upstream connection reuse.
4. Leave the “sticky” example commented unless you’re on **NGINX Plus** or add a third-party sticky module.

If you share your exact container names/ports and whether you’ll terminate TLS at NGINX, I can hand you a final drop-in `nginx.conf` with the map in the right scope.


# What is it 

Alright — let’s go through each directive in that `location /` block so you know exactly what’s going on and why it’s there.

---

## 1. `proxy_http_version 1.1;`

* **Purpose:** Tells NGINX to use **HTTP/1.1** when talking to the upstream (`backend` in this case).
* **Why:** HTTP/1.1 supports persistent connections and WebSockets. If you left the default (`1.0`), keepalive and upgrade mechanisms (like WebSockets) wouldn’t work correctly.

---

## 2. `proxy_set_header Host $host;`

* **Purpose:** Passes the **original Host header** from the client request to the upstream server.
* **Why:** Without this, NGINX would send its own Host (like `backend`) to the upstream, which might break virtual hosting, SSL, or app routing logic.

---

## 3. `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;`

* **Purpose:** Adds a header to tell the upstream the **real client IP address**.
* **Why:** By default, the upstream only sees NGINX’s IP, so logging and geo-based features wouldn’t see the actual user IP.

---

## 4. `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;`

* **Purpose:** Maintains a chain of all client IP addresses through multiple proxies.
* **Why:** If there’s already an `X-Forwarded-For` header from a previous proxy, `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` appends the current client’s IP to it.

---

## 5. `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;`

* **Purpose:** Tells the upstream what **protocol** (HTTP or HTTPS) the client used to connect to NGINX.
* **Why:** Useful when you terminate SSL at NGINX but the backend still needs to know the original protocol (e.g., for generating correct links).

---

## 6. **WebSocket headers**

```nginx
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
```

* **Purpose:** These two work together to enable **WebSocket** (and other HTTP upgrade-based protocols) through NGINX.
* **`Upgrade`**: Informs the upstream the client wants to upgrade from HTTP to WebSocket (or similar).
* **`Connection`**: Must be `"upgrade"` when upgrading; `$connection_upgrade` comes from a `map` in the `http` block that sets it to `"upgrade"` if `$http_upgrade` is non-empty, otherwise `"close"`.

---

## 7. `proxy_read_timeout 75s;`

* **Purpose:** How long NGINX waits for the upstream to send data before closing the connection.
* **Why:** Prevents WebSocket or long-polling connections from being cut off too early. The default (60s) is often too short for real-time apps.

---

## 8. `proxy_send_timeout 75s;`

* **Purpose:** How long NGINX waits for data **to be sent to the upstream**.
* **Why:** In slow networks, you don’t want the proxy to drop the connection just because sending took more than the default timeout.

---

## 9. `proxy_pass http://backend;`

* **Purpose:** The actual reverse proxy action — forwards matching requests to the `backend` upstream block.
* **Why:** This is where you connect your NGINX to your pool of containers (`server app1:8080; server app2:8080;` etc.).

If you like, I can redraw this block as a **diagram showing the client, NGINX, headers, and upstream flow** so it’s crystal clear how the request moves and why each header exists. That visual usually makes it click instantly.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
